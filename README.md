# Churn Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning. The dataset is preprocessed to handle categorical variables, and a logistic regression model is trained for prediction. The model is deployed as a Streamlit app, allowing real-time predictions and insights. This tool empowers businesses to take proactive measures to reduce customer churn and enhance profitability.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit app using `streamlit run Churn.py`.

## Project Structure

- `Churn.py`: The main Streamlit app for user interaction.
- `model.pkl`: The trained logistic regression model.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of required Python packages.
